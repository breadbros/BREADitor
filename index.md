### The Breaditor: A 2d Mapeditor for Photoshop Users
Made by (@mcgrue) initially for the 2d jRPG [Sully, A Very Serious RPG](https://sullyrpg.com/), the Breaditor is meant to be a general purpose 2d game level asset editing tool.

It is made with electron and javascript, using some webGL shaders to do the "heavy lifting" of rendering the game scenes while allowing developers to use webtech for the UI, and letting plugins be written by users in javascript.
